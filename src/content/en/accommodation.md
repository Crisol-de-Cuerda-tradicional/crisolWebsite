The foundation of this camp is sharing and coexistence. During the 7 days of the camp we will share music, dancing, singing and many more enriching experiences. We hope for fun and educational jam sessions too! The Granja Escuela de Arlanzón will be our home, some 20 kms. from Burgos city. It is a tourism centre that will treat us really well and allow us to enjoy additional activities. Also, we will share the week with some farm animals living in La Granja Escuela. They will be part of our company too!.

The course fee includes full board accommodation, in shared dorms between 6 and 13 people each, toilets and showers. The Granja Escuela has capacity for 130 people with welcoming facilities as well as other resources for groups in nature and leisure activities.

From the sharing and living together in Crisol, interesting projects, contacts and nurturing relations emerge, and that is the reason why we chose this kind of accommodation.

You can get to Burgos by [train](https://www.renfe.com/es/es), bus or [plane](https://www.aena.es/es/burgos.html), which flies from and to Barcelona.
