The Crisol Book was compiled in 2018 as a special edition meant to celebrate Crisol de Cuerda’s 10th anniversary. It a collection of the tunes that have been taught in Crisol over the years and has been gathered through audio recordings, videos, scores and manuscripts. Despite the fact that a few tunes are missing, it’s still a work in progress and we hope to add more tunes in the future.

The scores contained in this book have been transcribed as taught and recorded in Crisol de Cuerda. Although we are aware that discrepancies exist with the original tunes (or the tunes collected in other books) we wanted to preserve the variations that, for us, have become the standard way of playing the tune. Chords are provided for each melody as a guide so that anyone can play. They’re not meant to be exhaustive nor the only ones fitting for the melody. In fact, we’d like to encourage you to explore other alternatives and share them with us through our social media. This collection was created for divulgation purposes and the sale of the book or its contents is not authorised.

Following the Spirit of Crisol, we would like to share this collection hoping that you’ll have as much fun learning, playing and sharing it as we did in the past. Furthermore, we would like to extend an invitation for you to come to Crisol de Cuerda so that you can also share your music with us.

We could not finish this note without thanking once again Mr Alasdair Fraser and Ms Blanca Altable for their dedication and enthusiasm through the years. We would also like to thank all the teachers who shared their music and knowledge with us for the last 10 years. It is our hope that this book stands as a tribute to all the past experiences and all inspires the new ones yet to come.
