[Alasdair Fraser](https://www.alasdairfraser.com/) is the Alma Mater of the course; he is one of the best fiddlers of today’s folk music scene and a motivating teacher who directs similar projects in Scotland (Sabhal Mòr Ostaig), California ([Valley of the Moon Fiddle Camp](http://www.valleyofthemoon.org/) and [Sierra Fiddle Camp](http://www.sierrafiddlecamp.org/)) and also Australia ([Stringmania!](https://www.stringmaniacamp.com/)).

Our main cello teacher is [Natalie Haas](https://www.nataliehaas.com/), a young and vibrant cellist who has a great sense of creativity. Natalie has been touring with Alasdair since 2004 and they’ve released 6 studio albums together. She also teaches at the above-mentioned courses. Her lessons are more and more popular every year, and she is helping to release the cello from its classical structures and bring it to a new sphere, treating it as a principally chordal and rhythmic instrument.

Music transcends borders and cultures. Accordingly and along the years, we have invited musicians from different traditions to teach us about their musical languages and ways of playing so that we will have a full and complete learning experience by the end of the course. We have also added dance and singing as we consider them an essential part of our tradition.
