The Spirit of Crisol wants to bring together all the ideas and concepts that pushed us to organise a camp with the characteristics that follow but the first and most important is passion; **passion for music**.

To those not familiar with the term **fiddle**, what makes the fiddle different from the violin is not the shape of the instrument itself, but the musical language one chooses to speak with it. We will explore the possibilities of expression on the violin that are different from the typical ways in which we are used to hearing it (this philosophy can be applied to every instrument). The goal is not to play folk music on the violin, it is to **speak the language of the soul** with it, no matter what the musical style you want to play.

Our goal is also to have a course in which everybody can delight in their love for music and reject the implicit competitiveness that sometimes exists when learning to play an instrument.

There will be different levels of learning available, but everyone will interact, no matter whether they are beginners or advanced players – we don’t believe in boundaries; Crisol is inclusive.
