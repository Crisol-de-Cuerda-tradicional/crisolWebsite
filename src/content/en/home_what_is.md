title: What's Crisol de Cuerda?
---

**CRISOL DE CUERDA** is a gathering, a camp, where **creativity**, **knowledge** and **freedom** converge. It is a space and a time for music lovers that are interested in both **tradition and innovation**, for those who search for new **inspirations** and those who are ready for a new experience; **surprising**, **enriching** and **unforgettable**.

By the Arlanzón river, in a village by the same name and just 20 min away from Burgos city, fiddlers and other musicians of **all ages and all musical levels** will meet to share, learn and let their creativity run free. There will be **violins** (fiddles), **cellos** (big fiddles), **guitars**, **singers**, **flutes**, and many others. [LEARN ABOUT IT HERE!](/about/classes)

Masters on these instruments will offer you guidance in this journey, with an approach to music that is both **practical** and **fun**. All of this happens immersed in a natural environment that enables us to fuse Nature, music and dance in a powerful synergy, adding priceless value to Crisol de Cuerda. A unique educational project that is welcoming and safe.

We are lucky to have **Alasdair Fraser** and **Natalie Haas** with us, and many more masters. [CHECK THEM OUT HERE!](/teachers)
