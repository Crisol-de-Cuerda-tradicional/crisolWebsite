### SELF-MANAGED SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM

#### CRISOL DE CUERDA – GRANJA ESCUELA ARLANZÓN

The association Crisol de Cuerda Tradicional, non-profit organisation, and Granja Escuela Arlanzón are offering this year a self-managed scholarship program intended to help, as much as we can, all of those in a disadvantageous economical situation.

#### GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

The scholarships are meant for people who lack the economic resources to pay the total amount of the camp fees. The scholarships are mainly intended for emancipated students, unemployed or workers with low family income. Nonetheless, other circumstances will also be evaluated as long as they provide detailed documentation to justify their low economical income. Some of the circumstances are (but not only) being members of a large family or the number of dependants per salary. In any of these cases, documentation must be provided to demonstrate the candidate’s economical situation.

Even if you’ve applied for a scholarship, it is mandatory to go through the registration process and make a down payment. Please, specify in the registration comments that you wish to apply for a scholarship. We’ll get in touch with you to guide you through the next steps. If you’re not selected for the scholarship program you can either choose to pay the camp fee in full or to get the downpayment refunded.

The applicant’s data must always be true. Crisol de Cuerda is committed to the protection of all personal data and will make sure that any data provided for the scholarship program is only used for this end.

An important part of the screening process for the scholarships is the motivational letter. This should explain why you want to come to Crisol and transmit your enthusiasm to us.

If the committee perceives laziness and a lack of implication when reading your motivational letter, might consider the possibility to leave the scholarships deserted.

The Association may consider the possibility to offer other kinds of assistance/collaborations if deemed appropriate.

#### THE SCHOLARSHIPS

- Consists in a 25% discount over the total amount of the camp fees.
- This discount is non cumulative with any other discount of the course. The amount calculation will always be made over the total price of Crisol.
- Attendees who have been granted a scholarship are expected to assist the organisers during the course of Crisol. They will be tasked with simple tasks meant to assist with the logistics of the event.

#### DOCUMENTATION

- Photocopy of a photographic ID document (ie. Passport or ID card)
- Documentation to prove the economical situation of the candidate: Taxes certificate, unemployment certificate, etc.
- A document demonstrating the distance to camp: an invoice to the home address, plane tickets,…
- Curriculum Vitae or a brief text demonstrating the musical career and/or your interest in the instrument. No distinction will be made between professionals and amateurs.
- Motivational letter explaining why you want to take part in Crisol de Cuerda and why you need the scholarship.

#### HOW AND WHERE TO APPLY

The candidate will apply for the scholarship sending an e-mail at [inscripciones@crisoldecuerda.com](mailto:inscripciones@crisoldecuerda.com), and attaching all the required documentation (detailed above).

#### WHEN TO APPLY

All applications and documentation must be received before the 10th of April.

#### SCHOLARSHIP RULING

The scholarship rulings will be communicated to the candidates on the 15th of April.
