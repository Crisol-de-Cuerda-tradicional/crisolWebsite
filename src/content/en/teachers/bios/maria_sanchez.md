In 1998 she starts her training in figure skating. Six years later she starts teaching skating to different groups both for leisure and competition, which she has been doing to the present day.

In 2005 she discovers the world dances and the European Bal Folk. She falls in love with this genre of music and dance and that feeling impels her to participate in plenty of festivals and workshops across Europe.

In 2011 she collaborates with Juan Ramón Campos and his initiative for teaching Bal Folk in a self-managed center in Madrid: “CSA Tabacalera”, which continues today. From this moment she starts imparting her own traditional dance workshops, both in solitary and in workshop-concerts with different groups from the current folk scene in Spain and Portugal.

Her dancing training suffers a great transformation in 2011, when she discovers the tango. It becomes a significant element in her professional development, dedicating a main part of her teaching activity to this area.

In 2015, along with Franceso Palmeri, founds the association Folqué? promoting the Bal Folk by organizing classes, workshops, concerts and other events.
