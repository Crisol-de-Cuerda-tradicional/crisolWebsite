Pianist and musical therapist, Betlem started her professional path as a music and dance teacher in primary schools. In 2012 she left her job and made a bet on her passion. She moved to Ireland and joined the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance in Limerick. In 2013 she finished 3rd in the world championship of Irish dance. Back in Barcelona, she started the Irish dance school Mediterrania, where she teaches Irish dancing and balfolk.
Betlem is still active as a professional dancer and has performed with well-known international bands like Moxie, Capercaille, Luar na lubre, Celtas Cortos and Carlos Núñez amongst others. Her performances brought her to some of the most prestigious festivals in Germany, Austria, Belgique, Italy and France, and a good amount of stages in the Iberian Peninsula.
