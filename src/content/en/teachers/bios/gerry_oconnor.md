Gerry O’Connor comes from Dundalk, in County Louth and is the product of four generations of fiddle players. His recordings have focused strongly on local music and his work as a soloist and as a band member of Lá Lugh and Skylark is well known across the world. Over the past two decades he has recorded 12 albums and performed with all the leading performers of the Irish music industry including members of the Chieftains, Boys of the Lough, Planxty, De Dannan and Bothy Band. His solo album Journeyman has been hailed as one of the significant albums of Irish fiddle music in recent times. Gerry has also toured for more than fifteen years celebrating Irish and Breton music links with Gilles le Bigot (Barzaz, Skolvan), recording with him a live album in 2006 (In Concert). In the same period Gerry recorded and toured with The Irish Baroque Orchestra under the direction of Elizabeth Wallfisch, recording Ardee Dances, a piece commissioned from Rachel Holstead. Gerry (also a violin-maker, music teacher and music producer) currently tours with the Canadian Irish legends The Irish Rovers. He is a four times winner of the Fiddler of Oriel and regularly adjudicates the competition.
