Is one of the great masters of Scottish folk music. Born in Clackmannan, he discovered the fiddle at age 8, and it has accompanied him ever since. In 1973 he won the “National Mod” fiddle competition, and after graduating from university with a degree in physics he decided in 1985 to dedicate his life to music.

He is an exquisite performer, both dynamic and delicate, who has inspired millions of fiddlers around the world with his albums, performances and, for more than 20 years, his fiddle camps in Scotland and California. Now also in Spain.

His film credits include solo performances on the soundtracks of several major films, including Titanic, Last of the Mohicans, Wyatt Earp and The Spitfire Grill.

He formed the band Skyedance, whose very special latest album, “Live in Spain”, featured collaborations with some of the most important musicians from the Iberian Peninsula. Recently, apart from working with his friend and composer Paul Machlis, he has published four delicate and brilliant albums (“Fire and Grace”, “In the Moment”, “Highlander’s Farewell” and “Abundance”) with Natalie Haas. Both are a clear example of his free spirit, musical path and of the perfect duo they form together.
