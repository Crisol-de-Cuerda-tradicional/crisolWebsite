Colin Cotter picked up the fiddle at the age of 4, beginning a life-long journey building upon several generations of his familyâ€™s intimate relationship with traditional Finnish music. Over time, musical influences from Scotland to Quebec to New York City to West Africa crept in rendering him a genre-defying folky, unencumbered by traditional convention yet warmly familiar with it. As self-taught guitarist, he has crafted a unique accompaniment style that, in tandem with hard-hitting, poignant songwriting, bridges the gaps between American and Celtic folk music and rock. Colin has released 4 studio records of largely original music and has toured internationally as a lead-singer, guitarist, and front-man in several bands while also performing extensively as a guitar accompanist to traditional fiddlers of varying backgrounds.
