Alec Brown is a contemporary cellist from Pine Bluff, Arkansas who now lives in Limerick, Ireland. Having completed a practice-based Ph.D. at the University of Limerick in 2019 specialising in incorporating the cello into Irish traditional music, Alec continues to push the boundaries of what the cello is capable of within the idiom of Irish traditional music by collaborating with many artists both in and out of the tradition. As a result, he blends techniques that span multiple genres to create a unique sound which he can truly call his own.

Along with releasing his acclaimed solo album, The Stepping Stone in 2017, he has performed extensively throughout Ireland, England, Europe, Japan and has recently performed on Broadway in the cast of the critically-acclaimed Irish dance show “Velocity” at the New Victory Theatre in 2018, resulting in a 5-week tour of the US in March 2022. Alec is also a full-time member of award-winning singer-songwriter Emma Langford’s band, with whom he has toured throughout Germany in 2019 and 2021 and Ireland since 2013.
