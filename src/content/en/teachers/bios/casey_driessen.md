Casey Driessen is (just like his music) inspired, unconventional and truly original. His distinct and soulful approach to the fiddle has led to collaborations with artists such as Béla Fleck (& the Flecktones), Bassekou Kouyate, Jerry Douglas, Tim O’Brien, Darrell Scott, Steve Earle, & Zac Brown Band. Driessen’s style of funky fiddle rhythm is quickly earning him the reputation as the leader of “The Chop,” a new percussive bow technique permeating every corner of the fiddle/violin world. A choptastic interpretation of Jerusalem Ridge on his debut record, 3D, earned him a GRAMMY nomination and was hailed a “tour de force” (New York Times). He currently performs as The Casey Driessen Singularity—a one man, one fiddle, one pedal board show of live looping and effects. Following a successful Kickstarter campaign, Driessen created Fiddle/Sticks: The Drummer Project—a collaborative exploration of rhythm that pairs him with landmark drummers and percussionists and documents these explorations through recordings and videos.

In 2015, Driessen moved to Valencia, Spain, to become the new Director of Contemporary Performance (Production Concentration) master’s degree a Berklee College of Music’s recently opened international campus. As program director he’ll assist forward thinking, motivated and talented individuals of all instruments and genres develop their artistry through leveraging technology in their writing, recording and live performance.

And although you can’t hear them (or can you?), you know he’s wearing red shoes.
