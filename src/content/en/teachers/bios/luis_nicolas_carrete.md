Native of El Bierzo, he began his interest in traditional music with the work songs of his elders and by attending traditional music sessions, a passion he combined with musical training at the Ponferrada Conservatory. In León, he formed the groups Pandetrave and Robernscroll with the intention of adding new sounds to traditional Leonese music and joined the group Aira da Pedra. Graduated in guitar performance from CONSMUPA, he currently combines his work as an educator and performer collaborating with bagpipers such as Anxo Lorenzo, being part of the group Felpeyu, and with Llau, a recently formed ensemble alongside Dani Álvarez and Lisardo Prieto.
