Hugo Franco is a Galician guitarist and producer. His musical journey began in childhood, exploring percussion and developing a sound identity deeply rooted in rhythm.

After leaving the Conservatory, he consolidated his training at the E-Trad in Vigo, specializing in plucked string instruments under the tutelage of Xos√© Liz. Over time, he expanded his musical interest towards Blues, Old Time and Classical Music, while delving into Trap production, thus forging his own language.

He currently resides in Barcelona, where he is developing a project with violinist Marc Xarau, with whom he released the album 'Massa pel Cos' in 2024.

Additionally, he is part of Darach alongside Roo Geddes, a duo with which they have been awarded a Danny Kyle Award at Celtic Connections 2025. They are currently in the final production phase of their upcoming album, a new chapter in the constant evolution of their sound.
