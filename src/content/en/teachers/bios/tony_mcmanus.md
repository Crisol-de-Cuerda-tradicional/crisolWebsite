Tony McManus was born in 1965 in Paisley, Scotland, in a family with strong Irish roots.

He started off as a violin player, which led him to pick up the mandolin and then, at the age of 10, the guitar.Ha had always been passionate about traditional music, which he listened at home and in the radio.

Finding his unique voice in an instrument as popular as the guitar was a big challenge, as was applying a language with several centuries of history to an instrument with no real history. That was truly remarkable.

McManus has been acclaimed all over the world as the most influential guitar player of celtic music. In Tonyâ€™s hands, the complex ornamentation associated with fiddles and flutes gets transferred with precision to the guitar whilst preserving the emotional impact of the music.
