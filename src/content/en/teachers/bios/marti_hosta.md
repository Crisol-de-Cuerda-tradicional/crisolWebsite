Drummer, percussionist, actor and sound creator. It doesn’t matter where the sound comes from if it achieves the desired effect: he’s an expert at creating musical atmospheres to fit whatever’s happening. Started as a jazz and fusion musician, studying in the Escuela de Música de Badalona and then with Toni Meler, Ramón Ángel Rey or Marc Miralta, amongst others. He became more interested in traditional music by playing flamenco in the Talanos in Barcelona, the galician-catalan band Keympa and Coetus (Iberic Percussion Orchestra) founded by the singer Eliseo Parra.

He’s been on stage with Sílvia Pérez Cruz, Lídia Pujol, Judit Neddermann, Aziza Brahim, Marina Rosell, Marco Mezquida, Carles Dénia, Celeste Alías, Anna Ferrer, Elêctric Gozarela, Tara, etc…
