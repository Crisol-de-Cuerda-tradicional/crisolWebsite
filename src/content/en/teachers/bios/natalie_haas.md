Natalie’s youth has not stopped her from recording several albums and collaborating with many important musicians. She comes from a classical music background, but she began to be interested in Celtic music when she first came to Alasdair’s Valley of the Moon camp at the age of 11. Alasdair Fraser encouraged her to explore the rhythmic and harmonic basis that the cello once had in traditional Scottish music. Now she is a musical reference of incredible creativity and generosity.

She’s also a dedicated teacher, doing private tutoring, teaching at several of Fraser’s fiddle camps and at Berklee College. She performs regular with the Scottish fiddler and has recorder several CDs with him. Also collaborates regularly with other great musicians like Hanneke Cassel, Natalie Mcmaster, Patsy Reid, etc.
