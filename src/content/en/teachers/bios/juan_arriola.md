Is one of the more accomplished fiddlers in Basque traditional music. He first approached folk music in a self-taught manner while he was studying classical music in San Sebastian’s Conservatoire. After that, he’s always kept his love for the traditional repertoire and has contributed greatly to the basque tradition by recording two reference CDs with the band Alboka. He has also recorded the album Hariari Tiraka together with Arkaitz Miner, where they revisit many basque traditional melodies on two fiddles. He has also contributed with many compositions and acquired a rich and personal style. He currently works as a teacher in several music schools near his hometown.
