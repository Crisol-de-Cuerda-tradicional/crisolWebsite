José Climent is one of the pioneers of the fiddle in Castillian folk music. He is one of the founding members of the band La Musgaña and toured with them for many years, performing internationally all over Europe. In 1991, he started with Jaime Muñóz the folk music sessions of Taberna Elisa in Madrid. During those years he also performed with musicians such as Javier Bergia, Xosé M. Budiño, and Barahúnda. He taught Castillian bagpipes in Casa de Zamora (Madrid) from 1998 until 2013 and has performed and recorded several bagpipe albums. Between 2015 and 2018 he published two solitary projects. He is currently performing with two Castillian folk projects: Climent & Ballarín duo and trío Atairao. Both projects published new albums in 2022.

As a fiddle teacher, he has participated in multiple workshops with Begoña Riobó, Alasdair Fraser and Blanca Altable. Recently, he has started with Blanca Altable and Carlos Martín Aires the “Arrejuntada Violinera” (fiddle gathering), a physical and virtual gathering that looks for the characteristic sound of Castillian fiddle playing.
