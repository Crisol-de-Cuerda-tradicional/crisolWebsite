He is a self-taught mandolin player. Over 20 years ago he picked up a dusty mandolin and every single bluegrass album he could gather, he started playing and never stopped. He dwelled for years in the Americana music circuit but missed the Castilian music so much that he joined his brother Quique to get the Hermanos Cubero project started and fuse Ameicana and Castilian Music together.

The Hermanos Cubero have been a great success and performed in all kinds of festivals, venues and theatres in all the peninsula, sharing stage with bands like Los Planetas, Kepa Junkera, Manuel Luna, Los Deltonos or Guadalupe Plata.
