León, 1963, it’s hot there. A Coruña 1967, it's wet there.

Music awakens amongst guitars in his neighborhood and the beach. At 16, the conservatory. Very few people worth remembering from this era.

Nani García, Xosé Manuel Eirís, some folk... but at the time, too little self-confidence and no voice of his own. Then, in his twenties, the Xoven Orquestra de Galicia was just too much. Hence, cello gets locked away.

Without music in his life, only the office work is lect. Fastforward 10 years, Nirvana and “Red Hot” rescue this poor cello... and the blues, there's always the blues!!

Around the year 2000, he starts teaching in Ribeira... love and death. He moves to Cangas, until today, where he keeps on teaching. And an old dream: unlike a coin, life has got more than 2 sides, things can be another way.

Eugene Friesen (el Trio Globo), one sound, the voice.

He plays at popular celebrations and pubs. Traditional music and recorded music to play on fearless... that’s his school.

And at last, Alasdair and Natalie: the old dream made real, learning to love your own voice.

Now he is part of San Simón Fiddle, offering what he never had.

And of course there still are things to say, but how could you hold the whole sea in a bottle?
