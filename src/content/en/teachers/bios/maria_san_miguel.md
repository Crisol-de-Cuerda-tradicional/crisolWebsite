Beginning the violin at age three, Maria developed a passion for the instrument as well as a true vocation for music. She pursued her studies at the Conservatorio Profesional de Música de Valladolid and finished her music studies in University at the Conservatorio Superior de Música de Castilla y León. Her interest in trying to complete her music education brought her in touch with other music styles, eventually collaborating with the Edu Soto Plan Renove Band, Mariachi Guerrilla and more. Her newfound fascination for other culture´s music and its origins guided her to Scottish folk music which woke up her curiosity for the Castillian folk music being played in her own culture. Simultaneously her passion for teaching and pedagogy specialized in infants, learning from the musician and pedagog Paulo Lameiro, let her put together part of what is becoming a worldwide trend: Music Workshops for Infants. She has conducted these workshops to great success in both Spain and Germany. Currently, she continues her classical and folk music studies, taking classes from Alasdair Fraser, Natalie Haas, Diego Galaz, Begoña Riobó, Casey Driessen and belongs to the acclaimed European folk bands, “Atalantic Folk Trio”, “Brigantia” and “CastellanAs”.
