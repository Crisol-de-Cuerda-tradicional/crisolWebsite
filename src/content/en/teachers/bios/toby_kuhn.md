Spawned in Classical music and left to dry on the streets of Europe, seasoned with the spice of Folk and Funk, French cellist Toby Kuhn decants an exploration of his instrument through a wide array of collaborations and improvisations, bringing his love of the ephemeral and dedication to the unusual along in an ongoing adventure across style and invention. His projects fling him far and wide, from Balkan tunes to English songs and Anatolian ballads, from Old-Timey Americana to intensly arranged originals on a journey of discovery of a multi-faceted craft. Based in France, he regularly tours Europe and the world, always bringing plenty of enthusiasm along for the ride. An active hacker of his instrument, Toby's delight in learning new ways of playing is only matched by the passion he brings to spreading tricks and techniques around him, using his burgeoning teaching career to promote a whole new world of cello.
