Lucía López, from Valladolid, is a young multidisciplinary artist who takes traditional spanish culture as the main axis of her artistic communication.

After finishing her Spanish dance studies in Valladolid and her choreography degree at the CSD "Maria de Ávila" in Madrid, she began her career as a dance performer in the Sara Cano's company, Rajatabla Danza, and in her own company Colectivo Algazara where she also works as a choreographer. Her choreographic work has been recognized with a special mention at the C.C Distrito de Tetuán, and with the 2nd prize for Choreography at the C.C. Distrito Latina. In parallel to her work as a dancer, she is part of the musical project Delameseta by being the lead singer.

Lucía has engaged in teaching activities, giving workshops in schools such as EFAD-Granada, and at festivals such as WIM, Folkarria, Bolao Folk or Encuentros de Raíz.

Gradually, Lucía deepens her expertise in traditional culture, acquiring knowledge that she can effectively transmit and share through her classes and various projects in which she participates.
