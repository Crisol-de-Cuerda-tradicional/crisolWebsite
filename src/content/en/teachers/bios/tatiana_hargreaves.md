Over the past decade, Tatiana Hargreaves has been on the forefront of an up and coming generation of old time and bluegrass musicians. From placing first at the Clifftop Appalachian Fiddle Contest, to her bluegrass fiddling on Laurie Lewis’ GRAMMY-nominated album The Hazel And Alice Sessions, Hargreaves shows a musical fluency that flows between old time and bluegrass worlds with ease. She has toured with musicians such as Dave Rawlings, Gillian Welch, Laurie Lewis and Jake Blount. Her current duo with banjo extraordinaire Allison de Groot has been described as a “can’t-miss pair in” by Paste Magazine and has garnered the attention of Rolling Stone Country, the IBMA awards and the Canadian Folk Music Awards. Hargreaves has been the lecturer of bluegrass fiddle at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill since 2018.
