Born in the early 1960s in Ciudad de MÃ©xico, he is the grandson of exiled political refugees.
He grew up commuting between Colonia Condesa, near Roma (Mexico) and Colonia Catalana. After a few years, he abandoned his formal studies on Piano, classical Guitar and ethnomusicology to immerse himself in the fandangos of Sotavento, the topadas of huapango serrano and the depths of the huasteco violin. In the early 1980s, he emigrated back to Catalonia. Spent almost a decade in Barcelona trying to find his place and 25 more years in a small village near Girona, where his children were born. There he keeps working and building ties of family, community, culture and freedom.
