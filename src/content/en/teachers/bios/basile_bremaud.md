Through the violin and singing, he practices the traditional music from the Massif Central in France (regions of Auvergne, Limousin, Languedoc). He is deeply impressed with the force of this artistic expression, where singing, dancing and instrumental practicing are one. Nowadays, he researches the sound and the energy present in this music. He vividly experiences how its elements turn into movement through the dance bands he has founded (Duo Artense, Tornamai, TRES, la Clèda, Fai Petar).

He puts into perspective his knowledge on historic music (has taken part in the Musiciens de St Julien, under the direction of F. Lazarevic) and the experimental music from the collective La Nòvia (Flux, Trio Puech/Gourdon/Brémaud, la Baracande).

_Basile feeds his practice diving into music compilations close to folk musiciens and singers. Also, he has shared with musiciens and collectors who have kept this music alive for 40 years, such as J. M. Delaunay, J. P. Champeval, O. Durif…_

_From 2000 to 2003, he teaches violin in Brayauds (Departamental Centre of Traditional Musique of Puy de Dôme). In 2003 he is awarded an Academic Diploma of Musical Studies (DEM) on traditional violin in the Regional National Conservatory (CNR) of Limoges. He also owns a Estate Diploma as a teacher of traditional music since 2005._
