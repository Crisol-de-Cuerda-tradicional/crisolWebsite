Blanca Altable (1984) is one of the few fiddlers in the traditional scene in Castilla. She begins her studies of classic violin at 5 years of age, but soon she devotes herself to the fiddle, since hers is a family of traditional musicians.

With a particular and creative vision, she makes much of her repertoire from the dulzaina, her field work as a fiddler consisting in adapting scores for dulzaina to the fiddle. Particularly, music from the center and north of Castilla, since her grandfather, Simón Altable, was a dulzaina player, and started Blanca in the oral tradition from this region.

Out of this field work, she has co-founded two projects: Blanca Altable & Chuchi² y Cira Qu; And also participated in other folk projects like El Hombre Folkíbero & Cía.

Always in search and study, her advanced education as a fiddler grows with her participation in international fiddlecamps in California, New York and Scotland, getting closer to places and social environments where fiddle music happens in a vernacular and spontaneous way … Galicia, Basque Country, Quebec, Scotland, USA.

She has got opportunity of playing in scenarios and festivals all over Spain, showed her music in the USA, Africa and part of Europe, and participated in projects like VocalizÁfrica, Nélida Karr, Vallarna, Dario Bontempi, Salvador Amor, Pure Hemp, Sammy Jankis, Kasparov Vs Deep Blue, Roberta Medley, Sons d’ Cabiella…

She is an increasingly demanded teacher as well, committed with the personalized and creative education.
