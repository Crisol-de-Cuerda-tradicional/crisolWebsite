Born on the coast of Brittany, Jean-Michel Veillon is one of the most acclaimed wooden flute players in Europe. He was greatly influenced by the Irish flute masters and was the first one to adapt it to the Breton folk music. His style is unique and distinct.

He has performed all over Europe and the United States with bands like Kornog, Pennoù Skoulm, Den, Barzaz, Alain Genty, Toud’Sames, Jacques Pellen & Celtic Procession, Flook (Ireland), Gilles Le Bigot & Empreintes, Zakir Hussain & Pulse of the World (a marriage of music from India, Scotland, Ireland and Brittany), amongst many others.
