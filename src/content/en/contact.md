If you have any doubts related to Crisol, please feel free to send us an [email](mailto:info@crisoldecuerda.com) and we will get in touch with you as soon as possible.

The Asociación Crisol de Cuerda Tradicional is a non-profit organization, funded in 2009 and signed-up in the Registro de Asociaciones de la Junta de Castilla y León (No. 0004032) and in the Registro Municipal de Entidades Ciudadanas del Ayuntamiento de Burgos (No. 760).

Its aims include “to organize and promote events able to share, learn and teach musical knowledge and skills”. So was born Crisol de Cuerda, a unique project in its class in the peninsula.

Crisol de Cuerda is a project fully independent and self-managed, made possible thanks to the fees paid by the participants and the collaboration of many people who love and enjoy Crisol. To make it possible every year takes a great effort and hard work for months, but we believe it pays off because of its value for the participants, in the present, and because of the seed planted for the future.

If you wish to collaborate to keep this project alive, by donating or in any other way, you are more than welcome to send us an e-mail at [info@crisoldecuerda.com](mailto:info@crisoldecuerda.com?subject=How%20can%20I%20support%20Crisol)

Thank you very much
